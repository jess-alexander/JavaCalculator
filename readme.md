This Java Application is coded using NetBeans IDE by Jess Alexander with some guidance from YouTube on implementing the Swing framework. 

My aim was to mimick the funtionality of the apple calculator app on my iPhone and MacBook Pro. However,
I coded this solution not realizing that apple's calculator accounts for order of operation. My application
only computes two numbers at a time. 

It is also in desparate need of some styling. 

Posting to GitHub to mark progress after a day of coding.
