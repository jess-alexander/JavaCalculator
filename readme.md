This Java Application is coded by Jess Alexander with some guidance on implementing the Swing framework. 

My aim was to minick the funtionality of the apple calculator app on my iPhone and MacBook Pro. However,
I coded this soltuion not realizing that apple's calculator accounts for order of operation. My application
only computes two numbers at a time. 

It is also in desparate need of some styling. 

Posting to GitHub to mark progress after a day of coding.
